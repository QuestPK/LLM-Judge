You will be given a correct_answer and llm_answer couple.
Your task is to provide a 'total rating' scoring how well the llm_answer answers the user concerns expressed in the correct_answer.
Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the llm_answer is not helpful at all, and 4 means that the llm_answer completely and helpfully addresses the correct_answer.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
1: The llm_answer is terrible: completely irrelevant to the correct_answer asked, or very partial
2: The llm_answer is mostly not helpful: misses some key aspects of the correct_answer
3: The llm_answer is mostly helpful: provides support, but still could be improved
4: The llm_answer is excellent: relevant, direct, detailed, and addresses all the concerns raised in the correct_answer

Provide your feedback as follows:


Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 4)

You MUST provide value for 'Total rating:' in your answer.

Now here are the correct_answer and llm_answer.

correct_answer: {correct_answer}
llm_answer: {llm_answer}

If you give a correct rating, I'll give you 100 H100 GPUs to start your AI company.
